## Reasons for your hairloss

Hair loss can result from many factors including genetics, diet, hormonal imbalances, stress,illness, and even certain medications. In some cases, hair loss may be caused by an underlying medical condition. Here are some reasons which can cause hairloss:

<br>

**1. Stress** - When we're stressed out, our body releases cortisol (a hormone) which causes us to lose hair. Cortisol levels rise dramatically when we experience stress, whether physical or emotional. If you have been experiencing severe stress lately, try taking deep breaths and relaxing whenever possible.

<br>

**2. Illness** - A number of illnesses can cause hair loss. These include thyroid problems, lupus, diabetes, cancer, and others. If you notice any changes in your hair, make sure to get checked out by your doctor.

<br>

**3. Medications** - Certain drugs can cause hair loss. Be sure to check with your physician before starting any medication.

<br>

**4. Genetics** - Hormonal changes that occur during puberty can cause hair loss. As well, if you've had significant hair loss in the past, it's likely to happen again.

# How to prevent hair loss and improve hair health

Losing your hair not only affects your appearance, but it can also cause emotional stress and affect your confidence. There are a few things you can do to help stop hair loss. You may need to try several options before finding what works best for you.

## 1. Never Underestimate your diet

Try to eat a balanced diet. Your body requires certain vitamins and nutrients to function properly. A well-balanced diet includes protein, iron, zinc, vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, and folic acid. Many people who suffer from hair loss lack these nutrients.

## 2. Avoid using cheap products

If you are experiencing hair loss then you should try changing you hair products. Use shampoos that dont use sulphate as it damages your hair roots. Apply Hairoil such as our Kenchi Organic Hairoil made with herbs and organic ingredients.

## 3. Biotin and supplements

If you’re looking to speed up your hair growth even more, you can take supplements like biotin and iron. However, be sure to talk to your doctor before taking any supplements to ensure that they won’t have any adverse effects on your hair growth.

## 4. Use towel gently

Avoid rubbing towel with force after you take a shower as it breaks hairs from roots and cause hair loss. After taking a shower, place your towel on your head and let the water soak in automatically. After that let it air dry and avoid using blow dryer or diffusers.

## 5. Using the right tool for your hair

You should avoid using hot tools on your hair. Hot tools can cause permanent damage to your hair. Use a wide tooth comb and brush to gently detangle your hair. Do not pull your hair back tightly. This can lead to breakage and split ends. Avoid hair drying regularly as it can damage your hair roots and weaken them.

# Overall Conclusion

Hair loss can vary from person to person. Genetics and diet are the main reason for hairloss. If you are experiencing hair loss then you should start using the steps above to improve your hair growth. Try eating protien rich foods and massage your scalp for better hair growth.
